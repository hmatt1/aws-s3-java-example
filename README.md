# AWS S3 Java Example

Upload and download a JSON file from AWS S3 Object Storage

## Running the Application

If you want to run it, you'll need to go through this guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html

Follow these steps:

- Create an AWS account
- Create an IAM user
- Install Java and Apache Maven
  - You can skip Maven because this project uses the Gradle wrapper
- Configure credentials

Additionally, I would recommend installing [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). You can import this project into Intellij, and it should run smoothly!

## AWS Docs

AWS has some great documentation about the Java SDK to learn more: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/index.html

## Maven Central

The latest versions of the SDK can be viewed on Maven Central: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-s3
